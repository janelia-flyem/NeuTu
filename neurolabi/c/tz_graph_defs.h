/*
 * The data structure Graph_Workspace is designed to accommodate intermediate
 * results or provide allocated memory space for graph rountines. It has four
 * categories of fields:
 *   Status mask: Each bit of the mask indicates the status of the corresponding
 *                field;
 *   Attribute: Attributes of the graph to work on;
 *   Dynamic space: any pointer type field is a dynamic space. Its creation is
 *                  affected by the status masks. ON (1) in the mask 
 *                  <allocated> means the space has been allocated and ON in 
 *                  the mask <ready> means meaningful values can be retrieved
 *                  from the space. This saves time by reducing replicated 
 *                  operations;
 *                  Note: for those 2D pointers, there is a corresponding
 *                        field for recording their sizes (how many pointers
 *                        to pointer are there).
 *   Static space: It is used to store intermediate result temporarily. There is
 *                 no need to allocate them explicitly. It is not associated 
 *                 with any status mask.
